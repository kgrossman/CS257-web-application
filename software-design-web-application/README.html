        <h2>Description of our project:</h2>
        <p> This web application allows a user to search through data on causes of death
        in the United States. The data that we focus on includes the number of deaths
        for specificed causes of death, for each state in the United States as well as
        for the whole country, and for each year between 1999 and 2016.

        <h2>Our web app features:</h2>
          <p>-- Main search method: The user inputs a cause of death and state and specifies
                the range of the years that they want to search through. When the user clicks
                on the search table, they are presented with a table with columns for the year
                and for the number of deaths resulting from their specified cause of death
                in their specified state.
          <p>-- Search for the most deadly cause of death in a state: The user inputs a state
                and is presented with a table of the top ten causes of death in that state
                including the deathtoll.
          <p>-- Search for with state has the most deaths: The user presses the "go" button
                and recieves a table including a list of states and their overall deathtolls
                in order from greatest to least.
          <p>-- Search for a national trend: The user inputs a cause of death and is
                presented with a table including the years and their corresponding deathtolls
                for the specified cause.
          <p>-- Resource links: Located in the aside, their are links to more information
                about the causes of death.
          <p>-- Return to home button: Brings the user back to the main page.

        <h2>Our dataset:</h2>
          <p>Name: NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United states
          <p>Owner of data: Center for disease control and prevention
          <p>

        <h2>A feature we didn't have time to implement:</h2>
          <p>A feature that we did not have time to implement was a third
            column in our national trend data table that would include the
            percent that the deathtoll rose or fell.

        <h2>Creating our database:</h2>
          <p>Our original data set was in a CSV file. We used Matt's directory
            for our database (stritzelm). We used PostgreSQL to create a table of
            the four columns of the data that we wanted: year, cause, state, and
            deathcount by selecting those specific columns from the csv file to
            copy over. We did not write any scripts to pre-process our data.
